# Social-media
The aim is to be a stripped-down twitter application. This is to develop my skills in React, sequelize, and graphql. 

## Description
This is to allow users to post thoughts and review what other users have posted. This will combine re-thoughting and quote thoughting other user's thoughts. A user should be able to like other's thoughts and edit their own. The main feed should update, rerender, when a new thought is created as well as when a post is edited. The edit thoughts will be republished in the feed as if their were new thoughts. These will be distinguished by the edit date time created by the sequlize ORM. 

There is a bit of ChatGPT used to create the initial data mainly. 

## Goal
The goal of this project is to create a usable app showing off my skills and developing new ones. As well as help me find a position that can benefit from my skills. One way I am trying to help get my name out there is through twitch. I am building this during multiple streaming sessions on twitch and some work outside of that.

I am the main contributor to this project and do not plan currently to open it up to additional submissions.

My code camp instructor, Ross, has helped me get out of some stuck points. I also will be using a discord channel for assistance when I am stuck as well.
